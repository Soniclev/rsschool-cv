3. Developing, programming and other things related to IT is passion for me. I acquainted with programming in school around in 2013 year. We have learning Pascal. I can even participate in programming competition with others people in the district, but participate in another competition subject. In 2015 I had started to learn C#, which give me a very good knowledge base in programming (understanding OOP, static type languages and etc.). In 2017 I started to learn Python, which used very often. For 6 years I had wrote several programs, from simple useful scripts to sites. Also, for one year I completed around 30 homeworks and labs in C#, Python and Java ([globalfreelance.by](globalfreelance.by)).
